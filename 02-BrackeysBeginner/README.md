## TO DO:
1. Include "space" input to skip wait time during level transitions
2. Include current level fade in/out during level start
3. Add "high score" at top right corner during game
4. Add "continue" button between levels so it doesn't start player on next level immediately
5. Add high score table + player name input at credits with "View High Scores", "Replay", and "Quit" buttons
6. High score panel allows player to add own name to table, immediate update, and saves info for next plays. Include optional "reset high scores" button on bottom, and "Back" button.
7. Make level endless and random obstacle generation.
8. Allow player to change block color at start menu with "Settings" button.
9. Change WASD to horizontal/vertical
10. Deduct for falling off + hitting objects?
