## 03-ClearTheWay
My first original game! Push obstacles off the world for points, gobble up treats, avoid fast-moving eaters, and get pushed around by plowers in this hectic 1- or 2-player competitive game. Originally a test project to learn how to operate multi-camera views, and interact with in-game objects. Naturally evolved into a full game. Includes player settings and game menus.
